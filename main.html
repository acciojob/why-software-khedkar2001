    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        Since childhood, I have been fascinated by technology and how software can solve real-world problems. 
        The ability to create something impactful from just lines of code excites me. My curiosity led me to 
        explore programming, and over time, I developed a deep passion for software development. I enjoy the 
        logical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity involved in coding. Becoming a developer allows me 
        to turn ideas into reality, build innovative applications, and contribute to technological advancements 
        that improve people's lives.
